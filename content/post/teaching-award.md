In a virtual ceremony in the College of Science Council Meeting in March 2021, I was presented with a Teaching Excellence Award to recognise the variety of techniques to engage and motivate students I use, the continuous revision and development of the curriculum, and my engagement with the Widening Participation programme in UCD.
