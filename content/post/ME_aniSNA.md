**A protocol for assessing bias and robustness of social network metrics using GPS based radio-telemetry data**
We hope that the animal ecology community agree that this can serve as a useful resource in designing studies that seek to answer questions
on the structure of animal communities characterised using social networks. We use real datasets on five species of ungulates in differing environmental
settings to see how robust social network summaries are to downsampling. Typically, researchers can only tag a sample of the individuals in a population and 
inferences about social structure are inferred from these. Knowing how reliable different estimates are at various sample sizes is a crucial consideration, 
made even more complex by factors such as overall population size, autocorrelation of observations, etc. We not only answer some of these questions, but provide a 
step-by-step methodology for analysis and software to perform each of the steps.
